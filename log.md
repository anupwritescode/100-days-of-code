### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created scaffolding for a Tic-Tac-Toe app in Angular

**Thoughts** Used a two-dimensional array to store data and binded it to HTML elements. Added CSS to center the game on screen. Need to make it responsive.

### Day 2: June 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added winning logic to the app

**Thoughts** I thought a lot about the most efficient way to check this. Ended up writing if condition for all the 8 situations.

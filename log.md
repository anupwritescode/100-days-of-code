### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created scaffolding for a Tic-Tac-Toe app in Angular

**Thoughts** Used a two-dimensional array to store data and binded it to HTML elements. Added CSS to center the game on screen. Need to make it responsive.

### Day 2: June 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added winning logic to the app

**Thoughts** I thought a lot about the most efficient way to check this. Ended up writing if condition for all the 8 situations.

### Day 3: June 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to highlight winning triplet

**Thoughts** I first tried with ngStyles binding to the boxes, that didn't work. So, I bound the row and column with id of that element. I faced a weird issue when applying styles using id. I will fix that issue tomorrow.

### Day 4: June 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed highlight issue, added start a new game button

**Thoughts** The last element of the winning triplet wasn't being highlighted because the HTML element was being updated with X or O after the highlight class was added. Learnt Angular data bindings work asynchronously. To fix that I added a wait time of 50 ms before winning logic could be called. I learned something new today.

### Day 5: June 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed overwrite issue, added logic for draw, added bootstrap and fixed CSS of boxes

**Thoughts** I cool side-effect of my code I found today was after a draw and starting a new game, the turns switched but not after a win. This is usually the case in games. Made the app responsive.

<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created scaffolding for a Tic-Tac-Toe app in Angular

**Thoughts** Used a two-dimensional array to store data and binded it to HTML elements. Added CSS to center the game on screen. Need to make it responsive.

### Day 2: June 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added winning logic to the app

**Thoughts** I thought a lot about the most efficient way to check this. Ended up writing if condition for all the 8 situations.

### Day 3: June 23, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added logic to highlight winning triplet

**Thoughts** I first tried with ngStyles binding to the boxes, that didn't work. So, I bound the row and column with id of that element. I faced a weird issue when applying styles using id. I will fix that issue tomorrow.

### Day 4: June 24, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed highlight issue, added start a new game button

**Thoughts** The last element of the winning triplet wasn't being highlighted because the HTML element was being updated with X or O after the highlight class was added. Learnt Angular data bindings work asynchronously. To fix that I added a wait time of 50 ms before winning logic could be called. I learned something new today.

### Day 5: June 25, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed overwrite issue, added logic for draw, added bootstrap and fixed CSS of boxes

**Thoughts** A cool side-effect of my code that I found today was, when starting a new game after a draw result, the turns switched from 'X' to 'O' or vice versa, but this didn't happen after a win result. This is usually the case in games. Made the app responsive.

### Day 6: June 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS issue in mobile devices, fixed logic for new game. Created a screenshot app in python with GUI

**Thoughts** Added the tictactoe app to GitHub pages. Learned how to take screenshot through Python. Need better UI for both my apps, might take a UX course to understand the subject better.

### Day 8: June 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Changed CSS for tictactoe game app. Started solving hackerearth problems

**Thoughts** CSS of the app is now as you would expect of the game. Need to make the strikethrough animation for the winning triplet. Started solving hackerearth problems to improve my algorithmic skills. Need to focus on all projects equally.
